\chapter{Implementation and Simulation of Sensors}

\section{Sensors Implemented on Odin}
A brief description of the sensors on Odin used for situational awareness above the surface. How is the data processed?
\subsection{Radar}

\section{Generating Virtual Sensor Data}
How to generate realistic sensor data during simulation. Discuss complexity and benefits regarding generating raw data versus preprocessed information.

\subsection{Generating Data from Virtual Environment}
Using maps of sea and coast line, information of other simulated agents and 3D models of installations in sea (for example harbors) to decide what the sensors "see".

\subsection{Raw vs Preprocessed Sensor Data}
Complexity and benefits regarding generating raw data versus preprocessed information.
